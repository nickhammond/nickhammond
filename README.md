# Hi, I'm Nick. 

I’ve been working professionally on the internet building things for over 15 years. I’ve spent most of that time building Rails applications with a strong focus on Developer UX and DevOps.

More recently I've been helping companies migrate to and from the cloud with tools like Kamal and Terraform.

I'm also working on building a deployment dashboard for Kamal called [Shipyrd](https://github.com/Shipyrd/shipyrd). 

I currently have a small amount of time available for contract work, send me an [email](nick@fromthekeyboard.com) if you'd like to chat.
